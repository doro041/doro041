### Hi there 👋, my name is Doroteya Stoyanova
#### I am a Computing Science student 

I am a final-year Computing Science student with a strong foundation in Computer Vision and experience in Natural Language Processing. I have led two major Computer Vision projects as part of my academic research. My first dissertation focused on denoising fMRI scans using blind denoising techniques, aiming to enhance signal quality in neuroimaging data. My current dissertation explores real-time instance segmentation, with an emphasis on deploying efficient, lightweight models. The technical stack includes PyTorch, TensorFlow Lite, and Kotlin, tailored for real-time, mobile-compatible inference.

💻 Tech Skills: Most experienced with Python and Java, have some projects and experiences with React Native/Kotlin, experienced in Web Development.
🖌️ Design Skills : Digital Art, UX design,Graphic Design(flyers,posters,logo creation) - portfolio available upon request

- 🔭 At the moment, I am developing a real-time application for Few Shot Instance Segmentation of egg-berried lobsters. Yeah, it was an interesting topic for sure :).

- 🌱 I’m working on my masters thesis.
