### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Doroteya Stoyanova


I am a Master's graduate in Computing Science with a strong foundation in Computer Vision and hands-on experience in Natural Language Processing. I have led two significant research projects in the field of Computer Vision. My first dissertation focused on enhancing neuroimaging data quality through blind denoising techniques applied to fMRI scans. My second dissertation explores real-time instance segmentation, emphasizing the deployment of efficient and lightweight models for mobile applications. This project utilizes a technical stack comprising PyTorch, TensorFlow Lite, and Kotlin, optimized for real-time, on-device inference.

ðŸ’» Tech Skills: Most experienced with Python and Java, have some projects in React Native/Kotlin, experienced in Web Development.
- ðŸŒ± At the moment I am enjoying a small break prior to enrolling into a graduate program at JP Morgan 2025
